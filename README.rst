Flask-Reuploaded
================

Flask-Reuploaded provides file uploads for Flask.


Notes on this package
---------------------

This is an independently maintained version of `Flask-Uploads` based
on the 0.2.1 version of the original, but also including four years of
unreleased changes - at least not released to PyPi.

Noteworthy is the fix for the `Werkzeug` API change.


Goals
-----

- `Flask-Reuploaded` is a stable drop-in replacement for `Flask-Uploads`
- regain momentum for this widely used package
- provide working PyPi packages
