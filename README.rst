Flask-Reuploaded
================

Flask-Reuploaded provides file uploads for Flask.


Notes on this package
---------------------

This is an independently maintained version of `Flask-Uploads` based
on the 0.2.1 version of the original.


Goals
-----

- `Flask-Reuploaded` is a stable drop-in replacement for `Flask-Uploads`
- regain momentum for this widely used package
- provide working PyPi packages


Contributing
------------

Contributions are more than welcome. Please have a look at
https://github.com/jugmac00/flask-uploads/issues


Installation
------------

There is no released version on PyPi yet.

As the original `Flask-Uploads` is broken since months, this is a top priority.
